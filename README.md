Version 1 Included basic page setup, installing dependencies, like tailwind, and primevue. Allot of page routing and UI work + components created for the app part of the website plus the overall rough draft. 

Version 1.1 was the website creation. I initially wanted to have these two separate but it only made sense to combine them for the best experience. This included getting allot of Supabase related items ready like tables and schemas. Proper rules and routing, and combining the two repo's I had for elite-euro-app and eliteeuromotors.com, allot of styling and getting everything buttoned up for release.

Estimated day of release it September 1, 2024.

## Release Version 1.2 - Patch Notes

Updated the database schema to include detailed vehicle information such as make, model, year, and other specifications for comprehensive vehicle management.

### Axios Integration

#### VIN API Integration
- **Enhanced Vehicle Addition Workflow**  
Utilized Axios for HTTP requests to a third-party VIN decoding API, enhancing the vehicle addition workflow by auto-filling details using the VIN. Implemented error handling to manage and report errors during API requests, ensuring robustness.

#### Dynamic Image Fetching
- **Visual Enrichment**  
Implemented functionality to fetch vehicle images based on make, model, and year using a dynamic Axios request to an image search API, enriching vehicle profiles with visual data.

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Responsive Design for Vehicle Pages
- **Seamless User Experience**  
Enhanced the layout of vehicle addition and listing pages, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Ensured all vehicle data transmitted through the application is secured using HTTPS requests and maintained data integrity throughout the operation lifecycle.

#### Enhanced Authentication Security
- **Robust Security**  
Improved authentication flows with secure token management and session handling using Supabase, providing robust security against unauthorized access.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **VIN Decoding**  
VIN decoding may not support all vehicle types and might return incomplete data for some VINs due to API limitations.

- **Image Fetching**  
Image fetching is dependent on external API performance and availability, which might affect load times and data accuracy.

- **Word Cutoff**  
Allot of words are being cut off and hyphenated which was done on purpose but in some areas I'd prefer for the words to just go to the next line.

## Future Integrations

### Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) for Vehicle Diagnostics
- **AR-Based Diagnostics Tool**  
Implement an augmented reality feature that allows customers to use their smartphone cameras to scan their vehicle. The app would overlay information about specific parts and provide real-time diagnostics, such as potential issues or part replacement suggestions. This could be especially helpful for customers who want to understand more about their vehicle's condition before bringing it into the shop.

### Integration with Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Suggestions
- **Fuel Efficiency Monitor**  
Integrate with an API that tracks fuel consumption data and driving habits. The app could provide personalized tips on how to improve fuel efficiency based on the user's driving patterns, such as optimal speed ranges or maintenance suggestions that could improve mileage. This would not only help customers save money but also promote eco-friendly driving habits.

### Integration with Roadside Assistance Services
- **Roadside Assistance Feature**  
Integrate with a third-party roadside assistance service. In case of a breakdown or emergency, customers could quickly access this service directly through the app, which would automatically send their location and vehicle details to the service provider. This integration would offer peace of mind and convenience to customers, ensuring theyâ€™re covered even when theyâ€™re on the road.

### Integration with Car Wash and Detailing Services
- **On-Demand Car Wash and Detailing**  
Partner with local car wash and detailing services to allow customers to schedule on-demand or regular vehicle cleaning appointments through the app. The service could be offered at the customerâ€™s home, workplace, or at the auto shop after a service, providing an added layer of convenience.

### Carfax Integration
- **Vehicle History and Reports**  
Integrate Carfax to allow users to access detailed vehicle history reports directly within the app. This would provide added transparency and value, especially for customers considering the purchase of a pre-owned vehicle.
